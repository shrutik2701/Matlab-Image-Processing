"readraw.m" and "writeraw.m" are to be opened before running any of the programs.
For problem 1:
Steps:
1. Open "BilinearDemosiacing.m", "conv_img.m" . This contains solution code for 1(a).

2. Open "HistEquilization.m", "Bucket_fill_hist_eq.m", "Trans_func_hist_eq.m" . The first file contains code for both equalization techniques and uses functions present in the next 2 files. (solution to 1(b)) 

3. Open "clahe.m", "Bucket_fill_hist_eq.m", "Trans_func_hist_eq.m", "conv_img.m". Contains solution code for 1(c).

For problem 2:
Steps:
1. Open "Denoising.m", "gauss_filt,m", "uni_filt.m", "Bilt_filt.m", "zeropad.m". Contains solution for 2(a)-2(c).

2. Open "RGB_Denoising.m" in addition to the previous files. Contains solution to 2(d).

For problem 3:
Steps:
1. Open "WaterColorEffect.m" in addition to files used in problem 2.
